- run pytest:
pytest filename.py
# test functions should be named like "test*()"

- run tests from catalog:
py.test
# files with test should be named like "test*.py"

- run with printing details:
pytest filename.py -v

- run just one test method:
pytest filename.py::testname

- run methods containing some string in name (here - "add"):
pytest filename.py -k "add"

- using bool functions in "-k" attribute:
pytest filename.py -k "add or product"
pytest filename.py -k "add and string"

- running with marks:
pytest filename.py -m markname

-stop test after first failure:
pytest filename.py -x

-stop test after some failures (here - 10):
pytest filename.py --maxfail=1

- dont print failures analysis:
pytest filename.py --tb=no

- skip test:
@pytest.mark.skip(reason="why do not run this test")

- skip test by condition:
@pytest.mark.skipif(condition, reason="why do not run this test")

- print only summary of tests:
pytest filename.py -q

- print statements from test functions:
pytest filename.py -s
pytest filename.py --capture=no

usage of pytest.ini file:
- adding markers:
"""
[pytest]
markers =
    number: mark a test as a number
    strings: mark a test as a strings
